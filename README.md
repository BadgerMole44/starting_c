# Starting_c
## Purpose:
I am refamiliarizing myself with C syntax before taking an operating systems course. Using assembly in my computer architecture class was great so I want to continue exploring low level Programming.
##What?
I'm following along with the 2024 cs50 lectures on youtube. These programs are semi-related to the programs covered in the lecture videos minus the use of cs50.h.
